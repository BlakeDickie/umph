=head1 DESCRIPTION

printed to the standard output each separated with a newline.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h, --help>

Print help and exit.

=item B<-v, --version>

Print version and exit.

=item B<--license>

Print license and exit.

=item B<-q, --quiet>

Be quiet.

=item B<-t, --type>=I<arg>

Specifies the feed type to get. I<arg> can be one of the following:

  p, playlist  (arg0 will be treated as playlist ID)
  f, favorites (arg0 will be treated as username)
  u, uploads   (same)

Default is "p" (playlist). See also L</EXAMPLES>.

=item B<-s, --start-index>=I<arg>

"The start-index parameter specifies the index of the first matching result
that should be included in the result set. This parameter uses a one-based
index, meaning the first result is 1, the second result is 2 and so forth.

This parameter works in conjunction with the C<--max-results> parameter to
determine which results to return. For example, to request the second set
of 10 results, i.e. results 11-20, set the start-index parameter to 11
and the max-results parameter to 10."

  <http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/reference.html#start-indexsp>

umph defaults to 1.

=item B<-m, --max-results>=I<arg>

"The max-results parameter specifies the maximum number of results that
should be included in the result set.

This parameter works in conjunction with the C<--start-index>  parameter
to determine which results to return. For example, to request the second
set of 10 results, i.e. results 11-20, set the max-results parameter
to 10 and the start-index parameter to 11.

The default value of this parameter is 25, and the maximum value is 50.
However, for displaying lists of videos, we recommend that you set the
max-results parameter to 10."

  <http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/reference.html#max-resultssp>

umph defaults to 25.

=item B<-i, --interactive>

feed. By default umph selects all of the feed items.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item B<http_proxy>

umph depends on XML::DOM which uses LWP::UserAgent to fetch the data
over the network. LWP::UserAgent reads the http_proxy environment
setting. e.g.:

    env http_proxy=http://foo:1234 umph AAF3A1D0CA1E304F

=item B<Unavailable feeds>

Some feeds may have been set private by the Youtube users. umph
cannot currently fetch and parse those.
