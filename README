    In brief

umph is a command line tool for parsing Youtube playlists. It
dumps the parsed video links to the standard output, each link
separated with a newline.

Project:
  <http://umph.googlecode.com/>

Development repository:
  <git://repo.or.cz/umph.git>


    Installation

This is an optional step, you could just as well copy the bin/umph
file to your path and start using it. The installation takes care
of generating the umph(1) manual from bin/umph but you can also
use "perldoc bin/umph" if you want to skip the installation
altogether.

Prerequisites:

  * See Makefile.PL for these

If you choose to install:

  * Make sure you REMOVE any earlier version of umph before you continue

  * INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where umph will
  be installed, e.g.:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local

  * Typical steps:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
