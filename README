umph is a command line tool for parsing Youtube playlists. It prints
playlist video links, each separated with a newline, to the standard
output stream, while everything else gets printed to the standard
error stream. umph can be run with a simple interactive prompt to
select the printed video links.

Note that installation is *optional*. You can just as well copy the
bin/umph file manually to your path and start using it. The Makefile.PL
(and friends) exist primarily to ease the distribution process of umph.

* See Makefile.PL for prerequisites

* Make sure you remove any earlier versions of umph before you continue

* INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where umph will
be installed. For example:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local
