About
-----

umph is a command line tool for parsing Youtube playlists. It was written
to be used with cclive.

Installation
------------

Note that installation is *optional*. You can just as well copy the
bin/umph file manually to your path and start using it. The Makefile.PL
(and friends) exist primarily to ease the distribution process of umph.

* See Makefile.PL for prerequisites

* Make sure you remove any earlier versions of umph before you continue

* INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where clive will
be installed. For example:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local

Typical installation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test # optional step
make install
