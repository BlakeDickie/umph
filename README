umph is a command line tool for parsing Youtube playlists.
It was written to be used with cclive but other tools may
use it also.

Project:
  http://umph.googlecode.com/

Development repository:
  git clone git://repo.or.cz/umph.git


Installation
------------

Note that installation is *optional*. You can just as well copy the
bin/umph file manually to your path and start using it. The Makefile.PL
(and friends) exist primarily to ease the distribution process of umph.

* See Makefile.PL for prerequisites

* Make sure you remove any earlier versions of umph before you continue

* INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where clive will
be installed. For example:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local

Typical installation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
